- 👋 Hi, I’m @atlasjude32
- 👀 I’m interested in GIS to map food issues like waste reclamation and insecurity of access. I love puzzles - both physical ones and data-based.  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to merge social science backgrouund with data science. Also, webscraping, python/jupyter, SQL, R, Brouter, OSM, and always improving my ability with ArcGIS v.X
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on automation of map development using the above languages.
- 📫 How to reach me: messages here, twitter: @atlasjude , or an email to jjk.mapping@gmail.com
